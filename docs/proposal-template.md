# Introduction

The calculator project aims to develop a comprehensive, user-friendly application that caters to both basic and advanced mathematical operations. The calculator will perform essential arithmetic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as support trigonometric and hyperbolic calculations. The primary goal is to provide an intuitive interface that can be utilized by students, professionals, and researchers who require a reliable tool for solving various types of mathematical problems.

This application will be cross-platform, designed to function smoothly across multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. With a focus on speed and accuracy, the calculator will allow for scientific computations with up to 10 decimal points precision. By integrating Python’s tkinter library for the graphical user interface, the project seeks to deliver a lightweight and efficient tool that requires minimal setup and can operate offline.


# Anticipated Technologies

•	Python: The primary programming language used for developing the calculator application.
•	tkinter: The GUI library that will be used to create the user interface, allowing for easy interaction with the calculator’s functionalities.
•	math library: For advanced calculations, including trigonometric, hyperbolic, and logarithmic operations.
•	GitHub: Version control and repository hosting to manage code changes and collaborate as a team.
•	Cross-platform compatibility tools: No additional installation is required as Python's default libraries work across major operating systems.


# Method/Approach

The development process will be divided into several phases:
1.	Research and Planning: The team will gather and document all functional and non-functional requirements, ensuring that the core calculator operations are well-defined before development begins.
2.	GUI Development: The initial phase of coding will focus on building the calculator interface using tkinter. This includes setting up buttons, display screens, and ensuring usability for basic arithmetic functions.
3.	Core Functionality Implementation: After the GUI is set up, the calculator's core functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, trigonometric, and hyperbolic functions) will be implemented.
4.	Testing and Debugging: Unit tests will be developed to ensure that each calculator function behaves as expected, and the application will undergo rigorous debugging.
5.	Optimization and Cross-Platform Testing: The application will be tested on different operating systems to ensure compatibility and performance standards are met.


# Estimated Timeline

•	Week 1&2: Project Planning and Initial Research
•	Week 3&4: Initial GUI Setup using tkinter
•	Week 5: Implement Basic Arithmetic Functions (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
•	Week 6&7: Implement Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions
•	Week 8&9: Testing (Unit Tests, Debugging) and GUI Refinement
•	Week 10: Final Cross-Platform Testing, Performance Optimization, and Documentation

# Anticipated Problems

1.	Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensuring that the tkinter interface and Python functionality run smoothly across all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) may present challenges. Testing will be required to handle any unexpected behavior on different platforms.
2.	Accuracy of Calculations: While the calculator will aim for precision up to 10 decimal places, maintaining this level of accuracy for complex calculations might introduce issues with rounding errors or floating-point inaccuracies.
3.	User Interface Responsiveness: Maintaining an intuitive and responsive user interface, especially when handling more complex operations, could be a challenge. We anticipate needing to optimize the GUI to ensure it responds without delays.
4.	Managing Team Collaboration: Coordinating contributions from different team members via GitHub may lead to potential conflicts or issues with merging code. Ensuring all team members follow a consistent workflow will be critical for smooth collaboration.
