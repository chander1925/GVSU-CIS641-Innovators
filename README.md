# Innovators

The calculator project is designed to provide a versatile and user-friendly tool capable of performing both basic and advanced mathematical calculations. In addition to standard arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the calculator supports trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. Its primary goal is to assist users in various fields, including scientific, engineering, and educational contexts, by offering precision up to 10 decimal places. The calculator is designed for cross-platform compatibility and ensures quick performance and adaptability to different screen sizes, allowing a seamless experience for all users.

## Team Members and Roles

* Chander Singh Digari: Developer, responsible for implementing core functionalities like basic arithmetic operations and user interface.

## Prerequisites
